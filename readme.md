These probably dont work. If anything isnt my own, thats due to me looking for working code while learning. Sorry :/

menu.bat is the main file, but others should still work on their own

File Breakdown:
- menu.bat - Displays a UI to call each function
- netscan.bat - Scans all IPv4 Addresses within a domain (Default 192.168)
- portscan.bat - Uses the cache from netscan.bat to test via ftp if any ports are open on active devices
- scansub.bat - Slave file for portscan.bat, starts minimised by default
- pwget.bat - Fetches password for networks on the user's WLAN profile where possible
- update.bat - Clones the current repository and replaces local files
- replace.bat - Generated by update.bat, used so that update.bat may be updated itself
- cleanup.bat - Deletes all .txt files (used for cache) from working directory

Indev:
- fnscan.bat - Functions as a secondary menu which will be collapsed into the current netscan selection
- protonetscan.bat - WIP Fast Netscan, very buggy
- netsub.bat - Slave batch for protonetscan.bat
- test.nat - Just use it to test small sections of batch at a time

Dont Worry about the commit History, was trying to understand how all this works :>
